                    The poll tool was a school project that we had to make for a client within the school.
                    The subject of the project was to make the ideal tool for teachers all around the world.
                    We made a tool where teachers could log in and make a poll, after they made a question they got a code
                    that the teacher had to give to the students, and than the students could rate the poll, or answer the question.
                    The teacher will than get the answers in their profile, where they have a overview of the answers.
